# X.com UX Fixer

A Firefox extension designed to transform X.com (formerly Twitter) into a dense, efficient, text-based interface optimized for rapid content consumption.

## 🎯 Project Goals

Transform the X.com home feed from a visually cluttered, low-density interface into a high-performance, text-focused content consumption experience inspired by excellent CLI design principles.

### Core Principles
- **Density First**: Maximize content display without sacrificing readability
- **Text-Based Interface**: Prioritize text content over graphical elements and animations
- **No Hidden Options**: Eliminate hamburger menus, dropdowns, and slide-in popups
- **Content Excellence**: Apply proven content consumption patterns for optimal reading experience
- **Functionality Preservation**: Maintain all existing functionality while improving presentation
- **Performance Focus**: Reduce visual noise and improve scrolling performance

## 🚀 Key Improvements

### Target Issues
1. **Excessive Visual Clutter**: Remove unnecessary icons, buttons, and decorative elements
2. **Low Information Density**: Increase content per viewport through compact layouts
3. **Hidden Navigation**: Surface important actions and navigation options
4. **Performance Issues**: Reduce animations and visual effects that slow down scrolling
5. **Poor Content Hierarchy**: Improve typography and spacing for better readability

### Transformations
- **Feed Items**: Compact tweet layout with essential information only
- **Navigation**: Always-visible navigation with text labels
- **Actions**: Inline action buttons with clear labels
- **Typography**: Monospace or high-density fonts for better content scanning
- **Spacing**: Reduced padding and margins for maximum content density
- **Colors**: High contrast, minimal color palette for better readability
