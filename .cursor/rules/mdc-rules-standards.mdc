## Description

This rule ensures all MDC rules are properly structured, located in the correct directory, and prevents redundancy by consolidating related rules.

## Rule

### File Location and Structure
1. All MDC rules MUST be placed in the `.cursor/rules/` directory
2. All MDC rules MUST have the `.mdc` file extension
3. All MDC rules MUST follow the standard MDC format with proper YAML frontmatter
4. All MDC rules MUST include required fields (description, globs, ruleType)

### Required YAML Frontmatter
Every MDC rule MUST include these required fields:

```yaml
---
description: [Clear description of what the rule does]
globs: [Array of file patterns this rule applies to]
ruleType: [Always | Auto Attached | Agent Requested | Manual]
---
```

### RuleType Definitions
- **Always**: Rule is always included in model context
- **Auto Attached**: Rule is included when files matching glob patterns are referenced
- **Agent Requested**: Rule is available to AI, which decides whether to include it (must provide description)
- **Manual**: Only included when explicitly mentioned using @ruleName

### Rule Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the rule's purpose
- Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word names
- Prefix with project name if rule is project-specific
- Avoid generic names that could overlap with other rules

### Redundancy Prevention
Before creating a new MDC rule, check for existing rules that could be combined:

1. **Check for Similar Functionality**: Look for existing rules that cover similar topics
2. **Check for Overlapping Globs**: Avoid rules that target the same file patterns
3. **Consolidate Related Rules**: Combine rules that serve similar purposes
4. **Prefer Fewer, Comprehensive Rules**: Create 2-3 comprehensive rules rather than many small ones

### Redundancy Check List
- [ ] No existing rule covers similar functionality
- [ ] No existing rule has overlapping glob patterns
- [ ] New rule cannot be combined with existing rules
- [ ] Rule serves a distinct, non-overlapping purpose

## Examples

✅ Correct MDC Rule:
```yaml
---
description: Task Planning and Progress Tracking with Scratchpad
globs:
  - "tasks/ai/*.md"
  - ".scratch"
ruleType: Always
---
```

❌ Incorrect MDC Rule (missing ruleType):
```yaml
---
description: Some rule description
globs:
  - "*.md"
---
```

❌ Redundant Rules (should be combined):
```yaml
# Rule 1
---
description: Data organization standards
globs: ["data/**/*"]
ruleType: Auto Attached
---

# Rule 2 (redundant)
---
description: Data file formatting
globs: ["data/**/*"]
ruleType: Auto Attached
---
```
