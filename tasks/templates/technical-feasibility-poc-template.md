# Task: Technical Feasibility Proof-of-Concept (MANDATORY FIRST TASK)
Priority: CRITICAL
Estimated Time: 1-2 hours
Dependencies: Extension build, Firefox browser, access to target site
Status: Not Started

## Objective
**MANDATORY**: Prove that the target site can be successfully modified by a browser extension before any implementation work begins. This task MUST be completed successfully before any other tasks can be started.

## Background
This task exists because we have failed twice (FirstTechFed and X.com) due to not validating technical feasibility first. We will NOT make the same mistake again.

## MANDATORY POC REQUIREMENTS
The following MUST be proven on the REAL target site (not test pages):

### 1. Extension Loading
- [ ] Extension loads without errors in Firefox
- [ ] Content script executes on the target site
- [ ] No CSP errors in browser console
- [ ] Extension appears in Firefox's extension list

### 2. CSS Injection
- [ ] Basic CSS injection works (change background color, font, etc.)
- [ ] Changes are visible immediately
- [ ] Changes persist after page reload
- [ ] No CSP blocking of CSS injection

### 3. DOM Manipulation
- [ ] Basic DOM manipulation works (change text, hide elements, etc.)
- [ ] Changes are visible and persist
- [ ] Site's JavaScript doesn't immediately revert changes
- [ ] Selectors successfully target intended elements

### 4. Site Compatibility
- [ ] Extension works across different pages/sections
- [ ] Navigation doesn't break extension functionality
- [ ] Dynamic content loading doesn't interfere
- [ ] Site's framework doesn't fight against changes

## Steps
1. [ ] Build basic extension with minimal functionality
2. [ ] Load extension in Firefox
3. [ ] Navigate to target site
4. [ ] Check browser console for errors
5. [ ] Test basic CSS injection (change background color)
6. [ ] Test basic DOM manipulation (change text content)
7. [ ] Verify changes persist after page reload
8. [ ] Test on multiple pages/sections
9. [ ] Document all findings and results

## Data Collection
- Location: `tasks/human/validation/01-technical-feasibility-poc.md`
- Format: Screenshots, console logs, error reports, test results
- Validation: ALL requirements must be met for POC to be considered successful

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Extension loads and executes without errors
- [ ] CSS injection works and persists
- [ ] DOM manipulation works and persists
- [ ] No CSP or framework interference
- [ ] Extension works across site navigation
- [ ] All findings documented with evidence

## Failure Criteria
If ANY of the following occur, the POC fails and the project must be abandoned:
- [ ] Extension cannot load due to CSP restrictions
- [ ] CSS injection is blocked or reverted
- [ ] DOM manipulation is blocked or reverted
- [ ] Site's JavaScript immediately fights against changes
- [ ] Extension functionality breaks across navigation
- [ ] Console shows critical errors that cannot be resolved

## Notes
- This is a MANDATORY first task - no other work can begin until this is complete
- If this POC fails, the project must be abandoned immediately
- Document everything with screenshots and console logs
- Be honest about any issues encountered
- Do not proceed with implementation if there are any doubts

## Progress Updates
### [Date] - [Duration]
- [ ] Step completed
- [ ] Data collected
- [ ] Issues encountered
- [ ] Next steps

## ESCALATION
If this POC fails or encounters blockers:
1. **STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY**
2. Document the failure with specific details
3. Escalate to user with clear explanation
4. Do not proceed until blocker is resolved or project is abandoned
