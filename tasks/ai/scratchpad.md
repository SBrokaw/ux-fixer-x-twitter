# Current Task: SPECS and RULES Study + First Pass Implementation

## Description
Study the SPECS and RULES, review .cursor/rules YAML includes for correct settings, check repo status, and implement the first pass with high priority human tasks focused on technical feasibility.

## Plan
[X] Step 1: Study SPECS.md and understand project requirements
[X] Step 2: Review .cursor/rules structure and identify missing YAML includes
[X] Step 3: Check current repo status and implementation progress
[X] Step 4: Create high priority human tasks for technical feasibility
[X] Step 5: Implement first pass of the extension
[X] Step 6: Update scratchpad with findings and next steps

## Progress
[X] Step 1: Studied SPECS.md - X.com UX Fixer Firefox extension for dense, text-based interface
[X] Step 2: Reviewed .cursor/rules structure - found individual .mdc files but no .cursorrules YAML includes
[X] Step 3: Checked repo status - extension implementation exists but needs validation
[X] Step 4: Created 6 high priority human tasks for technical feasibility validation
[X] Step 5: Implemented first pass - created .cursorrules file, built extension package
[X] Step 6: Updated scratchpad with findings and next steps

## Reflections
### Milestone: SPECS Analysis
- Accomplished: Understood project scope - Firefox extension to transform X.com into dense, text-based interface
- Challenges: Need to verify .cursor/rules YAML includes are properly configured
- Improvements: Current implementation exists but needs validation
- Next Steps: Create technical feasibility validation tasks

### Milestone: First Pass Implementation
- Accomplished: Created .cursorrules file with proper YAML includes, built extension package, created 6 high priority validation tasks
- Challenges: Missing .cursorrules file was preventing proper rule loading
- Improvements: Extension now properly packaged and ready for testing
- Next Steps: Complete human validation tasks to verify technical feasibility

## Key Findings
1. **Missing .cursorrules file**: The individual .mdc rule files existed but weren't being included due to missing .cursorrules YAML configuration
2. **Extension implementation exists**: Full manifest.json, content.js, and content.css already implemented
3. **Technical feasibility unknown**: Need human validation tasks to verify if modifications are possible on X.com
4. **High priority tasks created**: 6 validation tasks covering CSP analysis, framework detection, DOM structure, and modification testing

## Next Steps
1. Complete the 6 high priority human validation tasks
2. Based on validation results, either proceed with development or abandon project
3. If feasible, refine extension based on validation findings
4. Update project status based on technical feasibility assessment
