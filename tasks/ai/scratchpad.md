# Current Task: CSP Investigation and Extension Functionality Validation

## Description
User reported that the X.com UX Fixer extension doesn't appear to do anything - the X.com home page looks identical. This suggests either:
1. X.com's Content Security Policy (CSP) is blocking our CSS injection
2. Content script is not executing properly
3. Selectors don't match current X.com DOM structure
4. Extension is not loading correctly

## Plan
[X] Implement direct CSS injection via JavaScript to bypass potential CSP issues
[X] Add visual feedback indicator to verify script execution
[X] Create local test page to verify extension functionality
[X] Build updated extension with new injection method
[X] Create CSP investigation task for manual validation
[ ] Wait for user to test the updated extension
[ ] Analyze results and implement additional fixes if needed

## Progress
[X] **CSS Injection Enhancement Task Completed**: 
    - Added performance monitoring and optimization
    - Implemented CSS validation and caching
    - Added comprehensive error handling
    - All 17 unit tests passing

[X] **CSP Investigation Started**:
    - Added direct CSS injection via JavaScript
    - Created visual feedback indicator
    - Built test page for local validation
    - Created validation task for manual testing

[ ] **Extension Functionality Validation**: 
    - User needs to test updated extension
    - Check if visual indicator appears
    - Verify CSS transformations work
    - Document any remaining issues

## Reflections
### Milestone: CSP Investigation
- **Accomplished**: 
  - Identified potential CSP blocking issue
  - Implemented direct CSS injection as workaround
  - Added visual feedback for debugging
  - Created comprehensive test page
  - Maintained all existing functionality

- **Challenges**: 
  - User reports extension has no visible effect
  - X.com's CSP may be blocking external CSS files
  - Need to verify if content script executes at all

- **Improvements**: 
  - Direct CSS injection should bypass CSP restrictions
  - Visual indicator provides immediate feedback
  - Test page allows validation without X.com access

- **Next Steps**: 
  - User should test updated extension
  - Check browser console for errors
  - Verify if visual indicator appears
  - Test on both local page and X.com

## Technical Approach
1. **CSP Bypass**: ‚úÖ Implemented direct CSS injection via JavaScript
2. **Visual Feedback**: ‚úÖ Added indicator to verify script execution
3. **Testing**: ‚úÖ Created local test page for validation
4. **Documentation**: ‚úÖ Created validation task for manual testing
5. **Analysis**: ‚è≥ Awaiting user test results

## Key Files Modified
- `scripts/content.js` - Added direct CSS injection and visual feedback
- `test-extension.html` - Created test page for validation
- `tasks/human/validation/09-csp-investigation.md` - Created investigation task

## Project Status Summary
- **Current Phase**: Phase 2 - Core Implementation üîÑ
- **Foundation**: ‚úÖ Complete (Phase 1)
- **Core Development**: üîÑ In Progress (Phase 2)
- **Content Script**: ‚úÖ Complete
- **CSS Injection**: üîÑ Next Priority
- **Testing & Validation**: üìã Next (Phase 3)
