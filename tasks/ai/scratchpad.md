# Current Task: Automated Testing Integration with web-ext

## Description
Integrate automated testing into the Firefox extension workflow using web-ext CLI tool and create a comprehensive testing framework with Playwright for headless testing and validation.

## Plan
[X] Step 1: Install and configure web-ext CLI tool
[X] Step 2: Create package.json with testing dependencies
[X] Step 3: Set up Playwright for headless browser testing
[X] Step 4: Create automated test suite for extension functionality
[X] Step 5: Implement CI/CD workflow with GitHub Actions
[X] Step 6: Create test documentation and validation framework
[X] Step 7: Integrate testing into development workflow
[ ] Step 8: Update rules and documentation

## Progress
[X] Step 1: Created package.json with web-ext, Playwright, and Jest dependencies
[X] Step 2: Set up Playwright configuration for integration testing
[X] Step 3: Created Jest configuration for unit testing
[X] Step 4: Implemented comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
[X] Step 5: Created GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
[X] Step 6: Created web-ext configuration for extension testing
[X] Step 7: Created comprehensive testing documentation
[X] Step 8: Added .gitignore for test artifacts

## Reflections
### Milestone: Testing Infrastructure Setup
- Accomplished: Created complete automated testing framework with web-ext, Playwright, and Jest
- Challenges: Needed to configure multiple testing tools and ensure they work together
- Improvements: Comprehensive test coverage with unit, integration, and extension testing
- Next Steps: Test the framework and update documentation

### Milestone: Test Implementation
- Accomplished: Created unit tests for content script functionality and integration tests for end-to-end validation
- Challenges: Needed to mock browser APIs and create realistic test scenarios
- Improvements: Tests cover DOM transformations, debug panel, error handling, and functionality preservation
- Next Steps: Run tests to validate the implementation

### Milestone: CI/CD Integration
- Accomplished: Created GitHub Actions workflow with matrix testing across Node.js and Firefox versions
- Challenges: Needed to configure proper artifact handling and reporting
- Improvements: Comprehensive CI pipeline with test reporting and artifact uploads
- Next Steps: Test the CI pipeline and refine as needed

## Key Components Created
1. **package.json**: Complete npm scripts and dependencies for testing
2. **playwright.config.js**: Configuration for headless browser testing
3. **jest.config.js**: Configuration for unit testing with jsdom
4. **web-ext.config.js**: Configuration for Firefox extension testing
5. **tests/extension.spec.js**: Integration tests for end-to-end functionality
6. **tests/content-script.test.js**: Unit tests for content script logic
7. **tests/setup.js**: Jest setup with browser API mocks
8. **.github/workflows/test.yml**: GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
9. **docs/testing-framework.md**: Comprehensive testing documentation
10. **.gitignore**: Proper exclusion of test artifacts

## Testing Framework Features
1. **Unit Testing**: Jest with jsdom for testing individual functions
2. **Integration Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end browser testing
3. **Extension Testing**: web-ext for Firefox-specific testing
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with matrix testing
5. **Reporting**: Multiple report formats (HTML, JSON, Markdown)
6. **Coverage**: Code coverage reporting with Jest
7. **Mocking**: Comprehensive browser API mocks
8. **Documentation**: Detailed testing guide and best practices

## Next Steps
1. Install dependencies and test the framework locally
2. Run the test suite to validate functionality
3. Test the CI/CD pipeline with a commit
4. Update project documentation to reflect testing capabilities
5. Create additional tests for edge cases and error scenarios
