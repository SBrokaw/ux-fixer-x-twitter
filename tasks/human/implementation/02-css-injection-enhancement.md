# Task: CSS Injection System Enhancement
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 2-3 hours
Dependencies: Content script implementation, current CSS system
Status: Complete

## Objective
Improve the CSS injection system to be more efficient, reliable, and maintainable. This includes optimizing CSS selectors, improving performance, and adding better error handling and debugging features.

## Steps
1. [X] Analyze current CSS injection performance
2. [X] Optimize CSS selectors for better performance
3. [X] Add CSS injection error handling and fallbacks
4. [X] Implement CSS caching and optimization
5. [X] Add CSS validation and debugging features
6. [X] Test CSS injection performance improvements
7. [X] Validate all existing functionality continues to work

## Data Collection
- Location: `styles/content.css`, `scripts/content.js`
- Format: Performance metrics, error logs, CSS optimization data
- Validation: Improved performance, better error handling, all tests pass

## Success Criteria
- [X] CSS injection is more efficient and reliable
- [X] Better error handling for CSS injection failures
- [X] Improved performance metrics (faster loading, less memory usage)
- [X] All unit tests continue to pass
- [X] CSS debugging features work correctly
- [X] CSS selectors are optimized and maintainable

## Technical Requirements

### Performance Optimization
- [X] Must reduce CSS injection time
- [X] Must minimize memory usage
- [X] Must optimize CSS selector specificity
- [X] Must implement efficient CSS caching
- [X] Must reduce DOM query overhead

### Error Handling
- [X] Must handle CSS injection failures gracefully
- [X] Must provide fallback styles when injection fails
- [X] Must log CSS injection errors for debugging
- [X] Must maintain functionality even with CSS errors
- [X] Must provide user feedback for CSS issues

### CSS Validation
- [X] Must validate CSS syntax before injection
- [X] Must check for CSS conflicts and overrides
- [X] Must ensure CSS compatibility with X.com
- [X] Must provide CSS debugging tools
- [X] Must monitor CSS application success

### Maintainability
- [X] Must organize CSS into logical modules
- [X] Must use CSS custom properties for theming
- [X] Must implement CSS versioning and updates
- [X] Must provide CSS documentation
- [X] Must enable easy CSS customization

## Notes
- This task builds on the successful content script implementation
- Performance improvements should be measurable
- CSS debugging features should help with future development
- All existing functionality must be preserved
- CSS optimization should not break existing transformations

## Progress Updates
### 2025-01-27 - 2 hours
- [X] Analyzed current CSS injection system and identified optimization opportunities
- [X] Implemented CSS performance monitoring with timing and statistics
- [X] Added CSS validation system with selector and property validation
- [X] Implemented CSS caching system with 30-second cache duration
- [X] Created optimized CSS application function with error handling
- [X] Enhanced CSS organization with custom properties and spacing system
- [X] Added comprehensive unit tests for all new CSS injection features
- [X] Updated debug panel to display CSS performance statistics
- [X] All 17 unit tests passing, including 6 new CSS injection tests

## Dependencies
- Completed content script implementation
- Current CSS injection system
- Testing framework for validation
- Performance monitoring tools
