# Task: Content Script Development
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 4-6 hours
Dependencies: Development environment, testing framework, X.com access
Status: Complete ✅

## Objective
Develop the core content script that will transform X.com's user interface into a dense, text-based experience. This is the foundation of the extension's functionality and must handle CSS injection, DOM manipulation, and dynamic content updates.

## Steps
1. [X] Set up content script structure and initialization
2. [X] Implement CSS injection system with proper CSP handling
3. [X] Create DOM transformation logic for feed items
4. [X] Add dynamic content detection and processing
5. [X] Implement error handling and debugging features
6. [X] Test with X.com home page
7. [X] Validate against testing framework

## Data Collection
- Location: `scripts/content.js`
- Format: JavaScript code, console logs, error reports
- Validation: Content script loads without errors, transformations visible

## Success Criteria
- [X] Content script loads and executes on X.com pages
- [X] CSS styles are properly injected and applied
- [X] Feed items are transformed to compact layout
- [X] Dynamic content updates are handled correctly
- [X] No console errors or CSP violations
- [X] Debug panel shows extension status
- [X] All tests pass in the testing framework

## Technical Requirements

### Content Script Structure
- [X] Must initialize when page loads
- [X] Must handle X.com's dynamic content loading
- [X] Must inject CSS styles safely
- [X] Must transform DOM elements without breaking functionality
- [X] Must provide debugging information

### CSS Injection
- [X] Must bypass CSP restrictions
- [X] Must apply compact styling to tweets
- [X] Must transform buttons and navigation
- [X] Must handle responsive design
- [X] Must maintain accessibility

### DOM Transformation
- [X] Must target tweet containers (`[data-testid="tweet"]`)
- [X] Must transform button elements with proper labels
- [X] Must handle text overflow and spacing
- [X] Must preserve all interactive functionality
- [X] Must work with X.com's React-based updates

### Error Handling
- [X] Must catch and log errors gracefully
- [X] Must provide fallback behavior
- [X] Must not break page functionality
- [X] Must report issues to debug panel

## Notes
- This is the most critical task for the extension's core functionality
- Must work with X.com's CSP restrictions
- Should be compatible with X.com's frequent UI updates
- Performance is critical - must not slow down page loading
- Must maintain all existing X.com functionality

## Progress Updates
### [2025-06-21] - [4 hours]
- [X] Content script structure implemented with proper initialization
- [X] CSS injection system working with CSP bypass
- [X] DOM transformation logic for tweets, buttons, navigation
- [X] Dynamic content detection with MutationObserver
- [X] Error handling and debug panel implemented
- [X] Unit tests pass (11/11) - all core functionality validated
- [X] Testing framework validation complete

## Dependencies
- Development environment with Node.js and npm
- Firefox browser for testing
- X.com account for access
- Testing framework (Jest, Playwright)
- Existing manifest.json and background script
