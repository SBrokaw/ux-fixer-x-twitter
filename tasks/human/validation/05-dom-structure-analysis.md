# Task: DOM Structure Analysis for X.com
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 45-60 minutes
Dependencies: Firefox browser, developer tools, X.com account
Status: Not Started

## Objective
Analyze the DOM structure of X.com to assess predictability and stability of selectors needed for the extension, particularly focusing on tweet containers, navigation, and action buttons.

## Assessment Steps
1. [ ] Open Firefox and navigate to https://x.com/home
2. [ ] Open Developer Tools (F12) and go to Elements tab
3. [ ] Inspect main feed container and identify primary selectors
4. [ ] Analyze tweet item structure and identify stable selectors
5. [ ] Check navigation sidebar structure and selectors
6. [ ] Identify action button selectors (like, retweet, reply)
7. [ ] Test selector stability by refreshing page multiple times
8. [ ] Document all key selectors and their stability

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Primary feed container selector identified and stable
- [ ] Tweet item selectors identified and consistent
- [ ] Navigation selectors identified and stable
- [ ] Action button selectors identified and consistent
- [ ] Selectors remain stable across page refreshes
- [ ] No dynamic selector changes detected

## Risk Indicators
- [ ] Selectors change frequently or unpredictably
- [ ] Dynamic class names with timestamps or hashes
- [ ] Complex nested component structures
- [ ] Selectors depend on dynamic content loading
- [ ] Different selectors on different page loads
- [ ] Heavy use of auto-generated class names

## Notes
Focus on data-testid attributes as they tend to be more stable than class names. Document both data-testid and class-based selectors for redundancy.
