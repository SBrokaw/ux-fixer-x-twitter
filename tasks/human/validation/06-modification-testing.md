# Task: Modification Testing for X.com
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 30-45 minutes
Dependencies: Firefox browser, developer tools, X.com account, basic extension
Status: Not Started

## Objective
Test if basic modifications to X.com are possible and persist, including CSS injection and JavaScript execution, to verify the extension approach is technically feasible.

## Assessment Steps
1. [ ] Open Firefox and navigate to https://x.com/home
2. [ ] Open Developer Tools (F12) and go to Console tab
3. [ ] Test basic CSS injection via console (change background color)
4. [ ] Test JavaScript execution (modify text content)
5. [ ] Test DOM manipulation (add/remove elements)
6. [ ] Load the basic extension and verify it loads without errors
7. [ ] Check if extension CSS is applied to the page
8. [ ] Verify modifications persist across page interactions
9. [ ] Test for any anti-tampering measures

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Basic CSS modifications possible via console
- [ ] JavaScript execution works without errors
- [ ] DOM manipulation possible
- [ ] Extension loads without CSP violations
- [ ] Extension CSS applies to page elements
- [ ] Modifications persist and don't get reverted
- [ ] No anti-tampering measures detected

## Risk Indicators
- [ ] CSP blocks console modifications
- [ ] Modifications immediately reverted
- [ ] Extension fails to load or inject content
- [ ] Anti-tampering scripts detected
- [ ] Dynamic content overwrites modifications
- [ ] Browser security blocks extension execution

## Notes
This is the final validation step. If this fails, the project is likely unfeasible. Test both manual console modifications and the actual extension.
