# Task: Technical Feasibility Review
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 1 hour
Dependencies: Built extension, Firefox browser, X.com account, developer tools
Status: Not Started

## Objective
Verify that the planned approach for the X.com UX Fixer extension (CSS/JS injection, selectors, browser APIs) is technically feasible on X.com, and that no critical blockers exist for the core transformation goals.

## Steps
1. [ ] Load the extension in Firefox
2. [ ] Open https://x.com/home and inspect the DOM structure
3. [ ] Confirm that the content script and CSS are injected and active
4. [ ] Check that key selectors (e.g., `[data-testid="tweet"]`, `[data-testid="primaryColumn"]`) are present and stable
5. [ ] Ensure that the extension is not blocked by Content Security Policy (CSP) or other site security measures
6. [ ] Test for any browser or platform limitations (e.g., extension permissions, script execution)
7. [ ] Note any technical risks or blockers

## Data Collection
- Location: tasks/human/validation/
- Format: Screenshots, notes, bug reports
- Validation: Successful injection and transformation of X.com elements

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Extension loads and runs on X.com without errors
- [ ] CSS and JS transformations are applied to the feed
- [ ] Key selectors are present and stable
- [ ] No critical blockers from CSP or browser limitations
- [ ] Any risks or issues are documented

## Notes
This review is required before investing further effort in implementation or refinement.
