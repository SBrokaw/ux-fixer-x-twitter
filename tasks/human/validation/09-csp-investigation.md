# Task: CSP Investigation and Extension Functionality Validation
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 1-2 hours
Dependencies: Extension build, Firefox browser, X.com account
Status: Not Started

## Objective
Investigate why the X.com UX Fixer extension appears to have no visible effect on X.com and determine if this is due to Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions or other technical limitations.

## Background
User reported that the extension doesn't seem to do anything - the X.com home page looks identical. This could be due to:
1. X.com's CSP blocking our CSS injection
2. Content script not executing properly
3. Selectors not matching current X.com DOM structure
4. Extension not loading correctly

## Steps
1. [ ] Test extension on local test page (test-extension.html)
2. [ ] Verify extension loads and shows visual indicator
3. [ ] Test extension on X.com home page
4. [ ] Check browser console for CSP errors
5. [ ] Verify content script execution
6. [ ] Test direct CSS injection method
7. [ ] Document findings and solutions

## Data Collection
- Location: `tasks/human/validation/`
- Format: Screenshots, console logs, error reports, test results
- Validation: Extension works on test page, CSP analysis, X.com compatibility

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Extension works on local test page
- [ ] CSP issues identified and documented
- [ ] Solution implemented (direct CSS injection)
- [ ] Extension functionality verified
- [ ] Technical limitations documented

## Technical Investigation Points

### CSP Analysis
- Check X.com's Content Security Policy headers
- Identify which CSS injection methods are blocked
- Test alternative injection methods
- Document CSP restrictions

### Content Script Execution
- Verify content script loads on X.com
- Check for execution errors
- Test selector matching
- Validate DOM manipulation

### CSS Injection Methods
- Test external CSS file injection
- Test inline style injection
- Test JavaScript CSS injection
- Compare effectiveness of each method

### X.com DOM Structure
- Analyze current X.com DOM structure
- Verify our selectors still match
- Check for dynamic content loading
- Test with different X.com states

## Notes
- Critical for understanding why extension appears non-functional
- May require CSP bypass techniques
- Could reveal fundamental limitations of browser extensions on X.com
- Results will inform future development approach

## Progress Updates
### [Date] - [Duration]
- [ ] Step completed
- [ ] Data collected
- [ ] Issues encountered
- [ ] Next steps

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Extension Works**: Identify and fix the issue, extension functions properly
2. **CSP Blocked**: Document CSP restrictions and implement workarounds
3. **Technical Limitation**: Document why extension cannot work on X.com
4. **Partial Functionality**: Identify what works and what doesn't
