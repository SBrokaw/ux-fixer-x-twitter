# Task: Framework Detection for X.com
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 30-45 minutes
Dependencies: Firefox browser, developer tools, X.com account
Status: Not Started

## Objective
Identify JavaScript frameworks and complexity used by X.com to assess if the site uses heavy SPA frameworks that might make modifications difficult or impossible.

## Assessment Steps
1. [ ] Open Firefox and navigate to https://x.com/home
2. [ ] Open Developer Tools (F12) and go to Elements tab
3. [ ] Look for framework indicators in HTML attributes (data-react-*, ng-*, v-*, etc.)
4. [ ] Check Sources tab for JavaScript framework files
5. [ ] Look for complex component hierarchies in DOM structure
6. [ ] Check for dynamic class names with hashes
7. [ ] Analyze JavaScript bundle complexity in Network tab
8. [ ] Document framework findings and complexity level

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Framework type identified (React, Angular, Vue, or other)
- [ ] Framework complexity level assessed
- [ ] DOM structure complexity documented
- [ ] No heavy SPA frameworks with complex state found
- [ ] Modifications appear feasible

## Risk Indicators
- [ ] Heavy React/Angular/Vue with complex state management
- [ ] Complex component hierarchies with dynamic rendering
- [ ] Dynamic class names with hashes that change frequently
- [ ] Large JavaScript bundles with complex frameworks
- [ ] Complex event-driven architecture
- [ ] Heavy client-side state management

## Notes
X.com likely uses React, but we need to assess the complexity level. Simple React usage is manageable, but complex state management could make modifications difficult.
