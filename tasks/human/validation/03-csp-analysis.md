# Task: CSP Analysis for X.com
Priority: High
Estimated Time: 30-45 minutes
Dependencies: Firefox browser, developer tools, X.com account
Status: Not Started

## Objective
Check for Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions on X.com that might block Firefox extension modifications, particularly CSS injection and JavaScript execution.

## Assessment Steps
1. [ ] Open Firefox and navigate to https://x.com/home
2. [ ] Open Developer Tools (F12) and go to Network tab
3. [ ] Refresh the page and look for CSP headers in response headers
4. [ ] Check for Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options headers
5. [ ] Go to Console tab and look for CSP violation errors
6. [ ] Test if basic CSS modifications are possible via developer tools
7. [ ] Document any CSP restrictions found

## Success Criteria
- [ ] CSP headers identified and documented
- [ ] No strict CSP blocking modifications found
- [ ] Basic CSS modifications possible via developer tools
- [ ] No CSP violation errors in console
- [ ] Extension modifications would be allowed

## Risk Indicators
- [ ] Strict CSP with 'unsafe-inline' disabled
- [ ] CSP blocking 'script-src' modifications
- [ ] CSP blocking 'style-src' modifications
- [ ] CSP violation errors in console
- [ ] Modifications immediately reverted by CSP

## Notes
Critical for determining if the extension can inject CSS and JavaScript. If strict CSP is found, the project may be unfeasible.
